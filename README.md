# RazorSharp
Low-level utilities and tools for working with the CLR and memory.

# Goals

RazorSharp aims to provide functionality similar to that of ClrMD, WinDbg SOS, and Reflection but in a faster and more efficient way. 
RazorSharp also allows for manipulation of the CLR and low-level operations with managed objects.
